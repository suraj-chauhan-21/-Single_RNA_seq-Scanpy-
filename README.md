# Single_RNA_Sequencing 
  using Scanpy
Imagine you have a basket of fruit (your tissue sample) containing strawberries, bananas, and grapes.

    Bulk RNA Sequencing is like putting all that fruit into a blender.

        The Result: A smoothie.

        The Problem: You can taste that it's sweet, but you can't tell if the sweetness came from 50 ripe strawberries or just one really sugary banana. You lose the identity of the individual ingredients.

    Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) is like making a fruit salad.

        The Result: A bowl of separate fruit pieces.

        The Benefit: You can pick up each piece and say, "This is a grape," "This is a strawberry," and "Hey, this specific banana slice is rotten!"

Why do we need it?

If you are studying a brain tumor (the fruit basket), Bulk Sequencing might tell you "There are cancer genes here."

But Single-Cell Sequencing tells you:

    Who is who: "These are immune cells, these are healthy neurons, and these specific guys are the tumor cells."

    The Rare Suspect: It finds the "rotten banana" hiding in the corner—a rare cell type that might be driving the disease but would be invisible in a smoothie.
